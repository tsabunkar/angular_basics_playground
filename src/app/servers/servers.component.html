<!-- 3 ways of using custome selector-->
<!--1)custome element/tag selector
selector: 'app-server',-->
<app-server></app-server>

<!-- 2)custome attribute selector
  selector :'[app-server]',
<div app-server> </div>  -->

<!-- 3)custome class selector  
  selector :'.app-server',
<div class="app-server"></div> -->

<b> Property binding</b>
<br>
<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer">Add Servers</button>
<!-- Note Square barcket means Property binding In the above we are property binding 
html attribute (ie- disabled attribute) we can also use property bidning to
bind directives and custome selector (compo)-->
{{allowNewServer}}

<hr>
<b> Even binding:</b>
<br>
<button (click)="onCreateServer()">CreateServer</button>
{{serverCreationStatus}}
<!-- 
  () mean it is Event binding, Inside the braces we specifiy the events like - onclick,
onmousehover,..etc but perffix dont have 'on' so, just click,mousehover,...etc  
Value we generally specifiy which function to be triggered when onclick of btn happens
[Note we can also specifiy the property name to be triggered in case of any event
occured but thats rare case]

In simple words click is the event for which ur binding to onCreateServer() fun
-> thus event binding
-->

<b> Usage of $event (is called $event object)</b>
<input type="text" class="form-control" (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)"> {{serverName}}

<!-- 
(input) is the input event which listen for input text value entered in it and then
invokes the function passed as value for this event binding. 

$event -> is like a "reseverd variable name" which is written in the html file
 while event binding.

 #This $event gives the inform of cooridantes where event occured, gives the access
to event data,fetch the event related inform,.. etc and this inform is passed to (.ts) file
specifically to the function in which it is written i.e-> UpdateServerName() 

#for above $event we r geeting information like -
InputEvent {isTrusted: true, data: "T", isComposing: false, inputType: "insertText", dataTransfer: null, …}
 -->

<hr>
<b> Two Way data binding:</b>
<br>
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="bindingTextBox">
<p>{{bindingTextBox}}</p>
<!--
   ngModel is called directives Note before using this directive need to import the
formsModule in app.module.ts file specifically inside imports array 
-->


<hr>
<b> Builtin directives</b>
<br>
<input type="checkbox" (change)="onCheckOfCheckBox()">CheckMe
<p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer">Server was created, server name is {{serverName}}</p>
<ng-template #noServer> 
  <p>
    No Server was created !
  </p>
</ng-template>
<!-- Writing the else condition using <ng-template> tag, where # represent local reference
 ng-template is the builtin directive from Angular which is used to mark/hold places 
 in the DOM -->
